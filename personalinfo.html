       <div class="text-y">Growing up in Ethiopia was truly an adventure that I will never forget. From the bustling streets of Addis Ababa to the serene countryside, I had the opportunity to experience the beauty and diversity of my country firsthand.<br><br>

        As a child, I was always curious and eager to learn. I remember spending hours reading books and exploring the world around me. My parents encouraged my love for learning and made sure that I had access to quality education.<br><br>
        
        My journey began at Gibi Gbreal School, where I attended kindergarten. I was only five years old, but I felt a sense of excitement and nervousness as I walked into the bustling schoolyard. Children were running around, laughing and playing games, while parents were dropping off their little ones. I remember feeling a bit overwhelmed at first, but I quickly made friends with other kids who were just as eager to learn as I was.<br><br>
        
        My teachers at Gibi Gbreal School were some of the kindest people I have ever met. They were patient, understanding, and always willing to lend a helping hand. They made sure that every child felt valued and important, regardless of their background or abilities. I remember feeling a sense of pride when I received my first report card, knowing that my hard work had paid off.<br><br>
        
        As I grew older, I changed schools a few times. I went from Gibi Gbreal School to Radical Elementary School and then back to Gibi Gbreal for my middle school years. Each new school brought new challenges and opportunities. I met new friends, learned new subjects, and discovered new passions.<br><br>
        
        When it was time for high school, I enrolled in Misrak Goh School for grades 11 and 12. It was a big change from my previous schools, but I was ready for the challenge. The curriculum was more rigorous, and the expectations were higher, but I was determined to succeed.<br><br>
        
        Throughout my academic journey, my parents were always my biggest supporters. They worked tirelessly to provide for our family, often sacrificing their own needs for ours. I remember my father waking up early in the morning to go to work, and my mother staying up late at night to finish household chores. They instilled in me a sense of determination and resilience that has stayed with me to this day.<br><br>
        
        However, despite my hard work and dedication, I failed the entrance exam to university. This was a difficult time for me, as I had always dreamed of pursuing higher education. But I refused to give up on my dreams. Instead, I enrolled in CPU College to learn web development.<br><br>s
        
        I am now 19 years old and still pursuing my dreams. My journey has been full of challenges, but I am grateful for all the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. From my humble beginnings in Kazanchis to my current pursuits as a young adult, I am excited to see what the future holds. I know that whatever comes my way, I will face it with determination, resilience, and a heart full of gratitude.</div>
